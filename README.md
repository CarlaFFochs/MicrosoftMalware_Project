# MicrosoftMalware_Project

As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft was challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. 
As with their previous, Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft was providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

In this project we've try to obtain the maxium information and conclusions about the dataset provided.
